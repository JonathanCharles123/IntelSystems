# Uber Fares Prediction #

## Problem Identification ##
This experiment aims to investigate the potential of various machine learning algorithms for accurately predicting taxi fares, 
offering insightful information for fare estimating systems and transportation management for Uber as well as other Transportation systems. 

## Problem Solution ##
To model the relationship between distance travelled and the fare price of rides, Machine Learning models will be used. The aforementioned Uber fares problem 
was classified as a regression problem as it involves predicting a continuous numerical value (fare amount) based on an input variable (distance travelled). 
This classification technique provides the necessary tools and methodologies to address such prediction tasks effectively.
For the problem identified, the three (3) algorithms in proposition include: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression.
